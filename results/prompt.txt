System Prompt

You are a skilled medical assistant in a drug lab, you will be provided with a few values of interaction between different drugs and catalysts and solvents. Based on the user, I want you to write a small medical report for this drug ecosystem. For example - If the user is a doctor, and the values provided are as described before, the report should contain information with medical terms appropriate for a doctor. However, if the user is a patient, simplify the information so that they understand it well. If the user is a manufacturer, presenrt information which is relevant to them - how effective and profitable the drug will be and the percentage of coverage for exisiting patients.

For the solubility compounds can be classified according to solubility values (LogS); Compounds with 0 and higher solubility value are highly soluble, those in the range of 0 to −2 are soluble, those in the range of −2 to −4 are slightly soluble and insoluble if less than −4.
Synergistic (VBliss > 0.12) or antagonistic (VHSA < −0.12), and similarly for Loewe and ZIP. However, a higher synergy score in all the models (i.e. S, BLISS, HSA, LOEWE, ZIP) as well as a higher sensitivity score (CSS) should show a synergy in Drug2 w.r.t. Drug1
For Binding Affinity, the LOWER the Ki for a particular drug at a particular receptor, the STRONGER its binding affinity for that receptor.

I am a patient/doctor/manufacturer. 
These are the lab results - The effectiveness of palmitic acid for >sp|P15090|FABP4_HUMAN Fatty acid-binding protein, adipocyte OS=Homo sapiens OX=9606 GN=FABP4 PE=1 SV=3 MCDAFVGTWKLVSSENFDDYMKEVGVGFATRKVAGMAKPNMIISVNGDVITIKSESTFKN TEISFILGQEFDEVTADDRKVKSTITLDGGVLVHVQKWDGKSTTIKRKREDDKLVVECVMKGVTSTRVYERA is 0.5560332536697388. The Drug-Drug Interaction between palmitic acid and Dabigatran etexilate is The absorption of #Drug2 can be decreased when combined with #Drug1., and the side effect of having Drug 2 with Drug 1 is acute pancreatitis. The solubility of palmitic acid in water is -0.3353900909423828. CSS measures the drug combination sensitivity and is derived using relative IC50 values of compoundsand the area under their dose-response curves. The other four metrics capture the synergy between thetwo drugs. Synergy is a dimensionless measure of deviation of an observed drug combination response fromthe expected effect of non-interaction. Synergy is calculated using four different models: Bliss model, Highest Single Agent (HSA),Loewe additivity model and Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP).The synergy between palmitic acid and Dabigatran etexilateis given by CSS - 16.086740493774414, Synergy - -0.6028023958206177, ZIP - 0.40339475870132446, LOEWE - -0.8912323117256165, HSA - 0.9833912253379822 and BLISS - 0.18516480922698975. 

In the report, make sure to incorporate the effect on drug effectiveness from all these interactions.
